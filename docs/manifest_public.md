# Φ-Cosmography — Public Manifest (OPEN Edition)

This repository contains the **public atlas of Φ-Cosmography** —
a visible surface layer of ORION's solar-system architecture.

Public includes:
• conceptual φ-maps
• inner solar floors
• visual & structural cosmography
• φ-layers matrix + static images

Protected (NON-public, core IP):
✗ ephemeris analytical pipeline  
✗ φ-resonance + cycle engines  
✗ Helion corridor metrics  
✗ X-Prime detection logic  
✗ ORION computational code

This repo is the **front-surface**, not the machine.
Core runs private until patent sequence T1→T2→T3.
