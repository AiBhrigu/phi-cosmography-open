# φ-Boundary-Link v1.0

## Purpose

Link layer binding Telescope · Lens · Frame

This symbolic boundary component establishes a static connection between three core φ-cosmography modules without implementing any runtime logic or calculations.

## Rules

### Static-Only
All content is static. No runtime computations, no dynamic behavior.

### Isolated
This module stands alone and does not depend on other system components.

### No Imports
No external dependencies or imports from other modules.

### IP-Shield Strict
All content is symbolic and general-purpose. No proprietary algorithms or calculations.

### No Optical Logic
This is a symbolic representation only. No actual optical calculations or geometry processing.

## Structure

- `index.js` - Static export object with version and connection metadata
- `diagram.svg` - Symbolic visual scaffold showing T-L-F connection with Φ marker
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Integration

This module is designed as an isolated addition to the φ-cosmography system. It provides a symbolic placeholder for future boundary integration without implementing any functional logic.
